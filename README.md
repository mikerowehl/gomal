# Go Implementation of Make a Lisp

Just playing around with some Go language features. I was just hacking on a 
few things, but I figured maybe going through the 
[Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) exercise would be a good way to
structure testing. So this is meant to drop in to the impls directory within
that repo and run from there. That's why there's some funky structure at the
top level here, like a Makefile and the run harness.
